# Notes

# How to prepare your Zuehlke Notebook
#### Best 
* Docker for Desktop
* Login for Docker Registry
* Binaries im system path: kubectl, docker-compose
* Best case WSL for  Windows
* Git

#### Medium
* Docker for Desktop
* Login for Docker Registry
* kubectl binary
* Windows command prompt

#### Super Basic
https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/ => Login with GitHab or Docker Account


## Procedure
* Explain, Demo, hands-on (continue to do it.)

## General Ideas
* Nice to have: Prepare a server with exercises. Students can ssh and need to figure out how many containers are running,
* Volunteers can present their solution. 
* Trainers present solutions after exercise  

## Overall technology
* Zoom with breakout session or Teams
* Zuehlke Miro Board

## We provide
* Handout
* Handout exercises
* Git URL?

## Discussed structure form Power Point
Docker Part 1
Why Docker & use cases (local development, in a cluster, etc.), understanding
default commands: docker run (attach & detach mode), docker ps -a, docker stop, docker rm, docker images, docker pull, docker exec, volumes
Run (tag), network, Image (build, Dockerfile),
Docker Part 2:
Compose (e.g. Milan Kafka Example), Docker CMD vs. Entrypoint, Troubleshooting very Important. Scenario with wrong configs and port mismatch, etc.

Kubernetes Part 1
40K feet view: cluster, orchestrator, etc.  declarative model and desired state, yaml, why pods, namespaces & dns (/etc/host fÃ¼r DNS => Jonathan rdp example), network basics, deployments, services (cluterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

Kubernetes Part 2

Crio-, explain persistence, explain secrets (meaning of key vault), config maps, labels selectors & annotations, rolling updates (Explain zero down time deployment  and corresponding business case). Ingress, Explain DB Schema Change. Liveness vs. readiness probe. Examples Jonathan CLI. Connect with kubeconfig

Logging & Monitoring
Docker & Kubernetes Logs, explain difference between metric & logs, (e.g. ingress dashboard), UC from project: email for end customer
HELM
